Your response goes here!

I've learned about searching in the MDN website, and new tags like <strong> and <em>.

All these are relatively easy since I've had experience before.

I've not run into a problem until now.. so nothing to report so far. But the drawing a picture strategy can really be helpful. Wish I had known that before.
